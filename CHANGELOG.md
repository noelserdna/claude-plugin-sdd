# Changelog

All notable changes to the SDD plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **MCP Server** (`server/`): TypeScript server exposing the SDD traceability graph via Model Context Protocol
  - 5 tools: `sdd_query` (text search with scoring), `sdd_impact` (BFS blast radius by depth), `sdd_context` (360° artifact view), `sdd_coverage` (gap analysis by domain/layer), `sdd_trace` (full chain traversal REQ→...→TEST with break detection)
  - 7 resources via `sdd://` protocol: `pipeline/status`, `pipeline/stages`, `artifacts/{type}`, `artifacts/{type}/{id}`, `graph/schema`, `graph/stats`, `coverage/gaps`
  - 2 workflow prompts: `analyze_impact` (pre-change workflow), `generate_status_report` (pipeline health)
  - Next-step hints on every tool response (GitNexus pattern)
  - Reads `dashboard/traceability-graph.json` with file watcher and graceful degradation
  - Registered via `.mcp.json` at plugin root
- **Context Augmentation Hook** (`hooks/sdd-augment-hook.js`): PreToolUse hook injecting SDD traceability context
  - Intercepts: Grep, Glob, Read, Edit, Write
  - Matches by file path (codeRefs), artifact ID patterns (regex), and symbols (code intelligence)
  - Formats: traceability chain, coverage status, last commit, callers/callees/processes when code intelligence available
  - Silent failure — never breaks tool calls
- **Code Index Skill** (`skills/code-index/` v1.0.0): GitNexus bridge for deep code intelligence
  - Modes: Full (GitNexus AST), Lite (regex, no call graph), Status, Refresh
  - Maps GitNexus symbols to SDD artifacts via `Refs:` annotations and transitive inference (max depth 2, confidence ≥0.7)
  - Enriches `traceability-graph.json` with `codeIntelligence` block (symbols, callGraph, processes, stats)
  - Reference: `bridge-patterns.md` (mapping rules, confidence calculation, community→domain mapping)
- **Graph Schema v4** (`graph-schema.md`): backward-compatible extension for code intelligence
  - New block: `codeIntelligence` with `symbols[]`, `callGraph[]`, `processes[]`, `stats`
  - New fields: `codeRefs[].inferred` (boolean), `codeRefs[].confidence` (0-1)
  - New relationship type: `inferred-implements`
  - Absent by default — all existing dashboards work without changes

### Changed
- **req-change**: New Step 8 "Code Intelligence Impact Analysis" — uses `sdd_impact` for symbol-level blast radius when MCP server available, with fallback to existing git log approach
- **traceability-check**: New Step 5.5 "Code & Test Chain Verification" — validates codeRef/testRef existence, detects orphaned annotations and uncovered code paths
- **reconcile**: New Phase 2 Step 5 "Code Intelligence Enrichment" — uses MCP server for scalable code scan instead of manual file-by-file reading
- **dashboard**: Enhanced Step 5 with code intelligence — uses `codeIntelligence.symbols[]` for precise data when available, adds `inferred-implements` relationships
- Plugin version bumped from 1.8.0 to 2.0.0

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-01

### Dashboard v5 — Interactive Prompts & Live Status (Phase 1)
- **Contextual Prompt Generation**: `getStagePrompt()` and `getNextAction()` produce Spanish-language, context-aware prompts based on pipeline state and coverage gaps — paste directly into Claude Code
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: All prompts have "Copy" buttons with toast notification feedback (clipboard API with fallback)
- **Next Action Card**: Prominent card at top of Summary view showing the single most important next step with reason and copy-ready prompt
- **Hero Recommendation Copy Buttons**: Each recommendation in the Health Score hero now has a copy button with a full contextual prompt (not just "/sdd:X" commands)
- **Pipeline Stage Popovers**: Click any pipeline stage to see popover with status, last run date, artifact count, stage-specific prompt with copy button, and "Filter by Stage" action
- **Activity Feed Panel**: Scrollable feed in Summary view showing real-time pipeline activity entries with timestamps, stage names, and status icons
- **JSONP Live Status Polling**: Loads `./live-status.js` every 5 seconds via `<script>` tag injection (works with `file://` protocol, no server needed)
  - `window.__SDD_LIVE_UPDATE(data)` callback updates activity feed and pipeline indicators
  - Live dot indicator: pulsing green (active), yellow (stale), hidden (no file)
  - Stale detection: heartbeat >60s + status=running shows "Possibly stalled" warning
  - Graceful degradation: silent no-op on 404, live dot hidden after 3 failures, race condition guard via timestamp comparison
- **New reference**: `live-status-template.md` — JSONP schema, field reference, idle seed template, skill integration instructions
- **SKILL.md v4.0.0**: New Step 9.5 "Generate Live Status Seed File" writes `dashboard/live-status.js` on dashboard generation
- **New output**: `dashboard/live-status.js` (JSONP seed file for live activity feed)
- **7 new CSS components**: `.toast`, `.copy-btn`, `.next-action-card`, `.prompt-block`, `.activity-panel`/`.activity-feed`, `.stage-popover`, `.live-dot`
