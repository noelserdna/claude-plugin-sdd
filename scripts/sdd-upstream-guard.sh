# H2: SDD Upstream Artifact Immutability Guard
# Hook type: PreToolUse (Edit, Write) | Timeout: 5s
# Enforces Art. 4 of the SDD Constitution: downstream skills cannot modify upstream artifacts.
#
# Immutability table (when stage X is running, these paths are PROHIBITED):
#   test-planner       → requirements/, spec/, audits/
#   plan-architect     → requirements/, spec/, audits/, test/
#   task-generator     → requirements/, spec/, audits/, test/, plan/
#   task-implementer   → requirements/, spec/, audits/, test/, plan/, task/
#
# Exceptions:
#   - spec-auditor (Mode Fix): spec/ is allowed (by design)
#   - req-change: requirements/ and spec/ are allowed (lateral skill)
#   - pipeline-state.json: always allowed (infrastructure, not pipeline artifact)
#   - No pipeline-state.json or no running stage: permissive mode (allow all)
