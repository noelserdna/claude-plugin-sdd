# Specifications Engineer (SWEBOK v4)

Professional specifications engineering skill that transforms software requirements into formal, structured specification documents following IEEE SWEBOK v4.

## Critical Workflow

**ALWAYS follow this sequence:**

1. **Read and understand** the existing requirements
2. **Analyze** them for quality, gaps, and ambiguities
3. **Ask the user** for decisions on every gap, ambiguity, or issue found
4. **If requirements are deficient**, generate a modification proposal before proceeding
5. **Create** the specification documents and folder structure
6. **Validate** the resulting specifications

---

## Modes of Operation

Determine which mode based on user intent:

### Mode 1: Analyze Requirements for Specification Readiness

Use when the user provides requirements and wants to move toward specifications.

1. Read [references/gap-analysis-checklist.md](references/gap-analysis-checklist.md) for the full analysis framework
2. Locate and read ALL requirement documents in the project
3. For each requirement, evaluate specification readiness:
   - Is it unambiguous enough to specify? If not, flag with options
   - Is it testable enough to derive acceptance criteria? If not, flag
   - Is it atomic enough to map to a single spec? If not, propose decomposition
   - Is the scope clear enough to define boundaries? If not, ask
4. Identify **gaps** in the requirements:
   - Missing stakeholder perspectives
   - Missing error/exception handling
   - Missing security requirements
   - Missing nonfunctional constraints (performance, scalability, availability)
   - Missing boundary conditions
   - Missing data lifecycle (CRUD + archiving)
   - Missing integration/interface requirements
5. Identify **ambiguities**:
   - Terms used inconsistently
   - Vague qualifiers ("fast", "easy", "user-friendly")
   - Unstated assumptions
   - Multiple valid interpretations
6. Identify **conflicts**:
   - Requirements that contradict each other
   - Requirements that are infeasible together
7. For EVERY issue found:
   - Present the issue clearly to the user
   - Provide 2-4 resolution options with a recommended option marked
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user decide
   - Record the decision for traceability
8. Produce a **Specification Readiness Report**:

```
# Specification Readiness Report

## Summary
- Total requirements analyzed: [N]
- Ready for specification: [N]
- Need clarification: [N]
- Need modification: [N]
- Missing requirements identified: [N]

## Issues Found
### Critical (blocks specification)
1. [REQ-ID]: [Issue] -> Options: [A, B, C] -> User decided: [X]

### Important (degrades specification quality)
1. [REQ-ID]: [Issue] -> Options: [A, B, C] -> User decided: [X]

## Gaps Identified
1. [Category]: [What's missing] -> [Recommendation]

## Decisions Log
| # | Issue | Options Presented | User Decision | Rationale |
|---|-------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | ...   | ...               | ...           | ...       |
```

### Mode 2: Create Specifications

Use when requirements are ready (after Mode 1 analysis or user indicates readiness).

1. Read [references/specification-workflow.md](references/specification-workflow.md) for the full specification process
2. Read [references/document-templates.md](references/document-templates.md) for available templates
3. **Ask the user** which specification format(s) to use:
   - **SRS (IEEE 830-style)**: Formal specification document
   - **Use Case specifications**: For complex workflows
   - **User Stories + BDD Scenarios**: For agile teams
   - **Actor-Action specifications**: For contractual/regulatory contexts
   - **Model-based**: For architecturally complex systems
   - Recommend the most appropriate based on project context
4. **Ask the user** about the project structure preferences:
   - Monolithic document vs. modular documents per feature/module
   - Naming conventions
   - Output directory
5. Create the folder structure using the script or manually:
   - Run `scripts/create-spec-structure.ps1` for PowerShell environments
   - Or create the structure manually based on the template
6. For each requirement, create the corresponding specification:
   - Map requirement to specification section
   - Choose the appropriate specification technique
   - Write formal, unambiguous specification text
   - Include acceptance criteria
   - Include traceability (REQ -> SPEC mapping)

   > **Research Questions:** When specifying technical decisions that require evaluation
   > of alternatives (e.g., REST vs GraphQL, encryption algorithm selection, database
   > engine choice), document the open question instead of assuming an answer.
   > Create `spec/RESEARCH-QUESTIONS.md` listing each question with its context,
   > the specification(s) it blocks, and candidate options identified so far.
   > These questions are consumed by `plan-architect` Phase 3 (Research)
   > for deeper investigation. This enables early identification of research
   > needs during specification, avoiding costly rework downstream.

7. Create the **Traceability Matrix**:

```
| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Specification ID | Specification Section | Status |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------|
| REQ-001        | ...                    | SPEC-001          | 3.1.1                | Done   |
```

8. At each decision point during specification writing, ask the user:
   - When multiple design approaches exist
   - When specification granularity is unclear
   - When acceptance criteria could vary
   - When interface boundaries are ambiguous

### Mode 3: Propose Requirements Modifications

Use when Mode 1 analysis reveals significant deficiencies in the requirements.

**IMPORTANT**: This mode activates AUTOMATICALLY when:
- More than 30% of requirements have critical issues
- Missing requirements exceed 20% of existing count
- Fundamental conflicts exist between requirements
- Core functionality is underspecified

1. Create a **Requirements Modification Proposal** document:

```
# Requirements Modification Proposal

## Executive Summary
[Brief description of why modifications are needed]

## Current State Assessment
- Total requirements: [N]
- Critical issues: [N] ([%])
- Missing requirements: [N]
- Conflicts: [N]

## Proposed Modifications

### Modified Requirements
| Original REQ | Issue | Proposed Modification | Rationale |
|-------------|-------|----------------------|-----------|
| REQ-001     | ...   | ...                  | ...       |

### New Requirements to Add
| Proposed REQ | Description | Category | Priority | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| REQ-NEW-001 | ...         | ...      | ...      | ...       |

### Requirements to Remove/Merge
| REQ to Remove | Reason | Merge Into |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| REQ-005      | ...    | REQ-003    |

## Impact Analysis
[Description of how these changes affect scope, schedule, and cost]

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Review this proposal with stakeholders
2. Use the requirements-engineer skill (/requirements-engineer) to re-elicit
3. Re-run specification readiness analysis
```

2. Present the proposal to the user with clear explanation
3. Ask the user whether to:
   - Proceed with specifications despite issues (document risks)
   - Go back to requirements phase (recommend using requirements-engineer skill)
   - Address only critical issues and proceed

### Mode 4: Validate Specifications

Use when the user has existing specification documents to review.

1. Read all specification documents
2. Check against [references/gap-analysis-checklist.md](references/gap-analysis-checklist.md) Phase 3
3. Verify each specification:
   - Has clear acceptance criteria
   - Is traceable to a requirement
   - Uses consistent terminology
   - Is implementation-ready (a developer could build from it)
   - Has no ambiguity
4. Verify the specification collection:
   - Complete coverage of all requirements
   - No orphan specifications (specs without requirements)
   - No orphan requirements (requirements without specs)
   - Consistent format and structure
5. Produce a **Specification Validation Report**

### Mode 5: Brownfield Specification

Use when the user has an **existing codebase** and wants to add specifications incrementally, rather than specifying everything from scratch.

**When to activate:**
- User mentions an existing project, legacy code, or working software
- There is source code but no `spec/` directory (or a partial one)
- User wants to formalize only specific modules or components

**Process:**

1. **Analyze existing codebase** — Scan project structure, entry points, and dependencies to build a component map. Identify bounded contexts, modules, and integration boundaries.
2. **Identify and prioritize modules** — Present the user a table of discovered modules with a recommended specification order based on: (a) business criticality, (b) change frequency, (c) dependency count, (d) risk level. Let the user reorder or exclude modules.
3. **Generate specs incrementally** — For each prioritized module:
   - Create only the relevant `spec/` subdirectories (not all are required)
   - Derive specs from code behavior (contracts, state machines, invariants)
   - Mark inferred specs with `[INFERRED]` — user must confirm or correct
   - Ask the user for acceptance criteria that the code does not make explicit
4. **Create `spec/COVERAGE.md`** — A living tracker of specification progress:

```markdown
# Specification Coverage

| Module | Domain | Use Cases | Contracts | NFR | Tests | Status |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|-------|--------|
| auth   | done   | done      | done      | —   | done  | SPECIFIED |
| billing| —      | partial   | —         | —   | —     | IN PROGRESS |
| reports| —      | —         | —         | —   | —     | PENDING |

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

5. **Integrate with other modes** — Mode 1 (Analyze) and Mode 4 (Validate) can run on partial `spec/` directories. Downstream skills (`spec-auditor`, `plan-architect`, `task-generator`) should scope their work to modules with status `SPECIFIED` in `COVERAGE.md`.

**Partial spec tolerance:** Not all `spec/` subdirectories need to exist. A brownfield project may have `spec/contracts/` and `spec/domain/` but no `spec/workflows/` yet. This is valid — downstream skills must check `COVERAGE.md` to know which modules are ready.

---

## Specification Folder Structure

**CRITICAL:** This is the canonical folder structure that ALL downstream skills expect. The folder is `spec/` (singular, no 's').

```

```

### Folder Structure Rules

1. **Always `spec/`** — never `specs/`, `specifications/`, or any variant
2. **Numbered domain files** — `01-GLOSSARY.md` through `05-INVARIANTS.md` are mandatory
3. **ID-prefixed files** — Use cases (`UC-NNN`), workflows (`WF-NNN`), ADRs (`ADR-NNN`) use sequential numbering
4. **Module-scoped contracts** — One API contract per bounded context/module
5. **CLARIFICATIONS.md at root** — Collects all business rules (RN-NNN) from user decisions during specification

### Input Requirements

This skill reads `requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md` (output of `requirements-engineer`) as its primary input. If this file does not exist:
- **Brownfield path:** Ask the user if they have an existing codebase to specify. If yes, activate **Mode 5** to derive specs from code. No formal requirements file is needed — specs are inferred from the codebase and confirmed with the user.
- **Greenfield path:** Recommend running `requirements-engineer` first to produce formal requirements before specifying.

When `REQUIREMENTS.md` exists but only covers part of the system (e.g., new features on an existing codebase), combine Mode 2 (for new requirements) with Mode 5 (for existing code without requirements).

### Creating the Structure

Create the folder structure manually or use the PowerShell script:
```powershell
.\scripts\create-spec-structure.ps1 -ProjectPath .
```

## Key Principles (Always Apply)

### Ask Before Assuming
NEVER make assumptions silently. Every decision point must be presented to the user with options. Use `AskUserQuestion` for every ambiguity, gap, or choice.

### Traceability is Non-Negotiable
Every specification MUST trace back to one or more requirements. Every requirement MUST have at least one specification. Orphans in either direction must be flagged.

### Iterative, Not Waterfall
If issues are found, stop and address them. Do not produce specifications over broken requirements. Better to go back than to build on a weak foundation.

### Implementation-Ready
Each specification must be detailed enough that a developer unfamiliar with the project could implement it correctly without additional clarification.

### Leverage Existing Skills
When requirements need modification, explicitly recommend `requirements-engineer` and explain how it can help.

## Needs Clarification Markers

When writing specifications, if a requirement is ambiguous and the user is unavailable or the session ends before resolution, embed a clarification marker directly in the spec text.

### Marker Format

```
<!-- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] NC-NNN: {concise question about the ambiguity} -->
```

- **NC-NNN** uses a global sequential counter across all spec documents (NC-001, NC-002, ...).
- Place the marker **immediately after** the ambiguous spec text it refers to.
- Markers are HTML comments so they do not affect rendered output but survive across sessions.
- A marker is never a substitute for asking the user — always prefer `AskUserQuestion` first.

### When to Insert

- The requirement was ambiguous and the user did not provide a decision during the current session.
- A design choice has multiple valid interpretations and no ADR or `CLARIFICATIONS.md` entry covers it.
- An external dependency or integration detail is unknown at specification time.

### Tracking File: `spec/CLARIFICATIONS-PENDING.md`

Maintain a living index of all open markers:

```markdown
# Pending Clarifications

| ID     | Document                        | Question                          | Inserted | Resolved |
|--------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|
| NC-001 | use-cases/UC-005-upload-cv.md   | Max file size: 10MB or 25MB?      | YYYY-MM-DD | —      |
| NC-002 | contracts/API-extraction.md     | Retry policy: exponential or fixed? | YYYY-MM-DD | —    |
```

When a marker is resolved in a future session, remove the HTML comment from the spec, move the row's `Resolved` column to the resolution date, and record the decision in `spec/CLARIFICATIONS.md` as a business rule (RN-NNN).

---

## Pipeline Integration

This skill is **Step 2** of the SDD pipeline:

```
requirements-engineer → requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md
        ↓
specifications-engineer → spec/ (THIS SKILL)
        ↓
spec-auditor → audits/AUDIT-BASELINE.md (Mode Audit + Mode Fix)
        ↓
plan-architect → plan/
        ↓
task-generator → task/
        ↓
task-implementer → src/, tests/
```

**Input:** `requirements/REQUIREMENTS.md` (from `requirements-engineer`)
**Output:** Complete `spec/` directory with all subdirectories populated
**Next step:** Run `spec-auditor` to validate the generated specifications

## Output Language

Respond in the same language the user uses. If the user writes in Spanish, respond in Spanish. If in English, respond in English.
